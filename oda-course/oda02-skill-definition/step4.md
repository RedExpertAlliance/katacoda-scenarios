Now you can start creating the intents for your skill!
You will create three intents for your skill:
  * Greetings: Any chatbot has to be polite and reply accordingly to a 'Hello'. This is usefull to indicate what can you do for the user.
  * WeatherForecast: Main intent of the skill. 
  * Help: You would usually have a help intent in case the user does not know how to use the bot.

Let's start with Greetings Intent. Go to Intents page and click on '+ Intent'
