In this scenario you will be consuming an external REST service to retrieve weather information.
In Oracle Digital Assistan this can be achieved by creating a Custom Component using the SDK provided and a couple of Node.js modules.

This is the first scenario of the Oracle Digital Assistant series where you will be using the terminal and VSCode within Katacoda.

As a prerequisite for this scenario, you have to create a free account on [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) and get a API Key.
