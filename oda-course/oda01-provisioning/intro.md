The assumption is that you are the administrator of the tenancy - either a fresh or preexisting cloud trial or a "regular" OCI tenancy.

If you don't have an OCI Tenancy yet, you have to go back to the first scenario in the OCI Course and do the 'Step 1 - Get hold of an OCI Tenancy' to get a Free Trial.

You can access the first scenario with the following link:
