1. For the name, you can add something that identifies your instance. In the screen you can see I named it 'odadev'.

2. For the shape, you have two options:

  * Development: minimum charge of 50 request per hour at the time of writing.

  * Production: minimum charge of 250 request per hour at the time of writing.

As you can see, the only difference is the number of requests and, for this hands-on, you can use the development shape so yoour credits will last longer.

Once you have filled the details click on 'Create'.
