# Core Concepts and Terminology

When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, a *tenancy* is created for you - or your company. This is a secure and isolated partition within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure where you can create, organize, and administer your cloud resources. Everything you do happens inside the tenancy.

The tenancy is organized in *compartments*, somewhat similar to folders on a file system. A compartment is a collection of related resources (such as compute instances, virtual cloud networks, block volumes, functions, API Gateway) that can be accessed only by certain groups that have been given permission by an administrator. A compartment should be thought of as a logical group and not a physical container. Compartments can be nested, to six levels deep. Compartments do not cost money - you can create many of them. The tenancy itself is the root compartment that holds all your cloud resources. When you create a cloud resource such as a VM, database, or data catalog, you must specify to which compartment you want the resource to belong. As an example: many tenancies contain a *Sandbox*  compartment, used for experiments and early development work. Security policies in this compartment are fairly relaxed compared for example to the *Production* compartment.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is physically hosted in *regions* and *availability domains*. A region is a localized geographic area - such as Amsterdam, Ashburn, Sao Paolo, Melbourne and Tokyo, and an availability domain is one or more data centers located within a region. A region is composed of one or more availability domains. Availability domains are isolated from each other, fault tolerant, and very unlikely to fail simultaneously or be impacted by the failure of another availability domain. When you configure your cloud services, use multiple availability domains to ensure high availability and to protect against resource failure. Availability Domains within a Region have very fast network connections; they should be thought of as very closely co-located. 

A tenancy has a home region - and can also subscribe to other regions. A tenancy therefore can have OCI resources in multiple regions. IAM resources (compartments, users, groups, policies, tags, and federation providers) are global - they exist across regions and are available in every region.

In the OCI Console, you usually work in the context of a single region. The *compartment explorer* is the only tool that shows *all* your OCI resources across *all* regions .

Note: some regions currently have a single Availability Domain. Oracle states: "For any region with one availability domain, a second availability domain or region in the same country or geo-political area will be made available within a year to enable further options for disaster recovery". Because of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's low latency interconnect backbone, you can even use cloud services in other geographic regions with effective results (when those services are not available in your home region), as long as data residency requirements do not prevent you from doing so.

A *fault domain* is a grouping of physical hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains provide anti-affinity: they let you distribute your VMs so that the instances are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance event that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains. In addition, the physical hardware in a fault domain has independent and redundant power supplies, which prevents a failure in the power supply hardware within one fault domain from affecting other fault domains. To control the placement of your compute instances, bare metal DB system instances, or virtual machine DB system instances, you can optionally specify the fault domain for a new instance or instance pool at launch time. For managed services on OCI - such as API Gateway, Functions and Autonomous Database, Oracle manages availability domains and fault domains for us.

A *virtual cloud network* is a virtual version of a traditional network — including subnets, route tables, and gateways. A cloud network resides within a single region but includes all the region's availability domains. Each subnet you define in the cloud network can either be in a single availability domain or span all the availability domains in the region (recommended). You can configure the cloud network with an optional internet gateway to handle public traffic, and an optional IPSec VPN connection or FastConnect to securely extend to your on-premises network. Through *remote VCN peering*, two VCNs in different regions (but part of the same tenancy) can be connected. This peering allows the VCNs' resources to communicate using private IP addresses without routing the traffic over the public internet or through your on-premises network.
