This scenario introduces some of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's core concepts. It will help you get an understanding of how to interact with and move around OCI.

The scenario uses both the OCI Console (in your web browser) and the OCI CLI (the command line interface in the Katacoda scenario terminal) and in Cloud Shell to interact with OCI.

Some of the concepts in this scenario:

* Tenancy, Region, Availability Domain
* Compartments
* Resources, OCID, Tags, Search
* OCI Command Line Interface tool
* OCI Browser Console
* OCI Cloud Shell
* Object Storage Service
* Users, Groups, Dynamic Groups, Policies
* Audit Trail

Note: in order to successfully negotiate this scenario, you should first have prepared your OCI tenancy as described in [this scenario](https://katacoda.com/redexpertalliance/courses/oci-course/oci-lab-preparation-cloud-trial) . This preparation ensures that the *lab-compartment* is created and a number of OCI resources required for this and subsequent scenarios are prepared in this compartment.
