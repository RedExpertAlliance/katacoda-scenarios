Users, Groups and Policies

Access to OCI resources is arranged through common mechanisms: every actor interacting with OCI uses a user account with associated credentials (such as username and password for Console login and public/private key pair for CLI and REST API access). Users are member of groups and from these groups they inherit permissions to access OCI resources. These permissions are defined through policies. Policies contain statements that describe which permissions on which resources are granted to which actors. You will see some examples of policies and learn how to grant required access on OCI Resources to specific users.

A special type of group is a Dynamic Group. Dynamic groups allow you to group Oracle Cloud Infrastructure computer instances or other resources as "principal" actors (similar to user groups). Instead of a static collection of users, the composition of a Dynamic Group is dynamically determined based on conditions. Any resource that satisfies the condition is considered part of the group - for as long as the condition holds true. For example, a rule could specify that all compute instances in a particular compartment are members of the dynamic group. During the time that the condition holds true, the resource inherits the permissions granted to the Dynamic Group through policy statements.
