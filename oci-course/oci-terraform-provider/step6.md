Managing a Function (including invoking the function)

In this step you will use a second Terraform configuration file to create a function and invoke that function. 

```
cp variables.tf terraform_details
cd terraform_details
terraform init
```{{execute}}

In this directory, the file `function.tf` defines a function resource as well as a function execution resource.

`function.tf`{{open}}

`terraform plan -out config.tfplan`{{execute}}

To make our plan real, use the following command. Terraform will apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

`terraform apply `{{execute}}

Enter *yes* when prompted to confirm our desire.

The output lists the response from the invoked function. You can check the results and output again using:

`terraform show`{{execute}}
