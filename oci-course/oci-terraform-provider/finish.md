# Summary

This completes your introduction to OCI Provider for Terraform. You have seen how very structured, readable files are used to describe OCI resources. The definitions make use of variables that can be read from environment variables, command line parameters and default values. Terraform can easily inspect existing resources in the OCI tenancy and make properties of these resources available to use in the definition of the managed OCI resources.  

You may want to take a look at the OCI Resource Manager: Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. You can create a *stack* from one or more configuration files. Subsequently, a stack can be materialized by running a *Plan Job* for the stack.
