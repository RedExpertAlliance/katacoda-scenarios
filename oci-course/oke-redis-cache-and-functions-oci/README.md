# Oracle Kubernetes Engine
INTRO

Oracle Kubernetes Engine is the Oracle offering for a Kubernetes cluster. It is a pure Kubernetes offering with integration with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 
components, such as:

- Load Balancer
- OCI compute
- OCI storage
- OCI Network
- OCI Security

If you are an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer that is looking for an alternative to deploy Kubernetes, OKE is a good option for that. You can use the 
Quick Create option, and in less than 10 minutes you will have a full Kubernetes cluster formed by:

- Three (03) nodes
- VCN
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway

And the option to provision Kubernetes Administration Dashboard, as well as Tiller.

# Scenario Pre-requisites

For this scenario you need to have a 30 days Free Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Trial. If you have it, you are ready to go. If not, please follow this
to provision your trial: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/request-trial-subscription.html

Kubectl and Kubernetes concepts are desirable to follow this scenario, but if you do not have it, you can follow it as well. 

# Scenario Description

In this scenario you will learn how to provision an Oracle Kubernetes Engine using the Quick Create Option.
Once you have your cluster we will deploy REDIS (https://redis.io/) that we will use as a database for a PHP based application. We will use the classic
PHP Guestbook application.
You will also learn:

- How to configure your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Command Line Interface (OCI CLI) to create the Kubernetes config file in order to manage your cluster 
using kubectl
- How to register a Docker image within OCIR (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry).
- How to configure a Load Balancer 
- How to deploy an application to the Cluster
- How to configure replicas for your application
- How to dinamically scale your replicas, based on CPU consumption
