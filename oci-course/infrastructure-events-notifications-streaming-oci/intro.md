OCI Events are published whenever OCI resources are manipulated. These events can trigger notifications, invoke functions and publish streaming events.

When for example a file is written to Object Storage, an OCI Event is published (in the form of a industry standard Cloud Event) that can lead to an email sent or a function invoked.
