You will first make some noise: by taking several actions through the Object Storage service, you make sure that there are some metrics generated for us to inspect. Then you will first retrieve the metrics through the Command Line Interface.

First you need to make sure that the bucket exists into which the files can be uploaded. Execute this command:
`oci os bucket create -c $compartmentId --name bucket-$LAB_ID`{{execute}}

Let's upload five new files to the bucket *bucket-$LAB_ID* - with 20 seconds pause after uploading each file. Note: the finest granularity at which the metrics are collected in OCI is one minute; all actions that take place within one minute of each other are aggregated together.
```
FILENAME=helloWorldFile$LAB_ID

for i in {1..5}
do
   echo "Uploading file # $i "
   NEWFILENAME="$FILENAME.v$i.txt"
   echo "Hello World in this Bright New File #$i" > $NEWFILENAME
   oci os object put --bucket-name="bucket-$LAB_ID" --name "$NEWFILENAME" --file ./$NEWFILENAME --metadata '{"file_tag":"HelloWorld_v$i"}'
   sleep 20
done
```{{execute}}

Now retrieve the list of files. Let's list the files in the bucket - to see the files you have uploaded:

`oci os object list --bucket-name="bucket-$LAB_ID"`{{execute}}

To get the details for the new files, execute this statement. It retrieves and downloads all five files. This will generate additional metrics.
```
FILENAME=helloWorldFile$LAB_ID

for i in {1..5}
do
   echo "Retrieving details for file # $i "
   NEWFILENAME="$FILENAME.v$i.txt"
   oci os object get --bucket-name="bucket-$LAB_ID" --name $NEWFILENAME --file "downloaded-$NEWFILENAME"
   sleep 12
done
```{{execute}}

We now have at least caused the creation of two sets of metrics from the Object Storage Service: for PUT requests (that created new objects) and for GET requests (that retrieved these objects). Additional metrics are available for object count, request latency (first byte and all bytes) and total bytes stored.

To retrieve some metrics:

This returns the number of objects in various buckets over the most recent three datapoints (spaced one hour apart)
`oci monitoring metric-data summarize-metrics-data --compartment-id=$compartmentId --namespace oci_objectstorage --query-text "ObjectCount[1m].sum()"`{{execute}}

This returns the number of objects in *bucket-$LAB_ID* over the most recent three datapoints (spaced one minute apart)
`oci monitoring metric-data summarize-metrics-data --compartment-id=$compartmentId --namespace oci_objectstorage --query-text "ObjectCount[1m]{resourceDisplayName = "bucket-$LAB_ID"}.sum()" --resolution 1m`{{execute}}
Note: for no good reason that I can think of, this previous query frequently does not return any results, even though we clearly have created files in the bucket. 

Count the put requests to Object Storage (aka the file uploads) into bucket-$LAB-ID over the most recent three datapoints (spaced one minute apart):
`oci monitoring metric-data summarize-metrics-data --compartment-id=$compartmentId --namespace oci_objectstorage --query-text "PutRequests[1m]{resourceDisplayName = "bucket-$LAB_ID"}.sum()" --resolution 1m --output table`{{execute}}

The responses to the metrics requests can quickly grow pretty sizable. Typically you will make these requests to collect data for analysis. To better inspect the response, you could save it to a file, using `> filename`. For example:

`oci monitoring metric-data summarize-metrics-data --compartment-id=$compartmentId --namespace oci_objectstorage --query-text "PutRequests[1m]{resourceDisplayName = "bucket-$LAB_ID"}.sum()" --resolution 1m > putrequests-bucket-$LAB_ID.txt`{{execute}}

Then open the file in the editor or use cat to inspect the file contents.
`cat putrequests-bucket-$LAB_ID.txt`{{execute}}
