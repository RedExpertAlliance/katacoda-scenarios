The OCI Console is the browser based GUI for managing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You probably have worked before with OCI Console, for example in the scenario Introduction to OCI. We will now use the Metrics Explorer, a tool in the OCI Console that allows exploring, analyzing and visualizing metrics collected in the OCI Metrics lake.

Open the OCI Console - for tenancies subscribed to the Ashburn region, the URL is:

https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/

Login using the console credentials provided by the lab instructor.

Navigate to the Metrics Explorer: in the *hamburger menu*, select Solutions and Platform | Monitoring | Metrics Explorer, or go straight to: https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/monitoring/explore.
