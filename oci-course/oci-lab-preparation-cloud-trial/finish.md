# Summary

This completes the scenario for preparing the OCI Tenancy for running the REAL OCI Katacoda Scenarios.

The tenancy now has the *lab-compartment* and a small number of resources. Some policies have been defined to allow services to operate inside the compartment. 

You should have local copies of the file *config* and *oci_api_key.pem*.  

You and your tenancy are all set for the first *real* scenario.
