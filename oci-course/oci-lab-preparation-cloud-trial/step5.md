At this point it would be most convenient if you can compile a document with all relevant credentials for executing the scenarios. This document should contain:

* tenancy name 
* private key (contents from file oci_api_key.pem)
* config file with tenancy ocid, user ocid, fingerprint, region and reference to private key file
* OCIR docker username and password (namespace/<user> and generated auth token)
