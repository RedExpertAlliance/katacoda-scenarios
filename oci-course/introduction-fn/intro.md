This scenario introduces serverless Functions with Project Fn. It was prepared for the Meetup Workshop Cloud Native application development on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure on January 20th, hosted by AMIS|Conclusion in Nieuwegein in collaboration with REAL (the Red Expert Alliance) and Link from Portugal.

The scenario uses an Ubuntu 18.04 environment with Docker, Fn CLI and Fn Server running locally. 

You will create Functions locally and deploy them to the local Fn Server. Functions can then be invoked through the Fn CLI or through regular HTTP clients such as CURL.

The scenario works with Node (JS) and Java as runtime languages. You can experiment with Go, Ruby, Python as runtimes just as easily.
